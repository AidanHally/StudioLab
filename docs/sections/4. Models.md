# Models

You will need a few more models to manage devices, users, accounts and locations with your API. 

In this section we will learn about creating models as standalone files in your repository. In the long run this will make it easier for you to reuse these models and manage schema evolution more effectively.

### Add JSON Models
Create stand alone `JSON` files for the following user, account and location models. You can find descriptions and examples of what these models should look like below.

To do so, click on the blue 'plus' icon (`+`) on the top left of the UI and select 'model'. This example gif demonstrates how to add a new model file and fields.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> ### Use the Common scope & JSON format
>*That way your models will be created as independent *`JSON`* files rather than written inline in the *`OAS`* file.*

### User
**Description**: *Users associated with a CloudHome account. Administrative priviledges are indicated to show which users can configure device management and which users can only interact with configured devices.*

![user model](../../assets/images/user.png)

### Account
**Description**: *Users can belong to multiple accounts on CloudHome's federated services. In other words users have a unique id that can interact or manage devices on more than one account or location.*

![account model](../../assets/images/account.png)

### Location
**Description**: *Device geolocation at most recent update. Users can optionally choose to turn off geolocation, however key features such as mapping will not be available.*

![location model](../../assets/images/location.png)

> ### Reminder...
>
> *Don't forget to frequently push changes to your git branch to make sure that you save your progress.*

If you wish to add descriptions or additional validation to your fields you can do so as demonstrated in the following example.

## 2. Add References
Select the `device.v1.json` model and add references (`$ref`) to the new models you added in the previous step. This will create a complete representation of the schema used to manage devices. 

In other words, within the `device.v1.json` model, add references to the `user.v1.yaml`, `account.v1.yaml` and `location.v1.yaml` files.

The following example demonstrates how to add references (`$ref`) to a model:

<!-- theme: success -->

> ### Mission Accomplished!
>
>*Now that you have plenty of models, you can use them in your endpoints as request and response bodies. Continue to the next section called '**Endpoints**'.*
