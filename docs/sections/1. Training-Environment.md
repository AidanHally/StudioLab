# Training Environment

To complete this workshop you need access to **Stoplight Studio** in your browser, provided by a [**Stoplight workspace**](https://stoplight.io/welcome/create) or you can download the [**Studio application**](https://stoplight.io/studio/) to your desktop or laptop.

You will also want to `fork` this [Github repository](https://github.com/stoplightio/StudioLab) and then import it into Studio to start the lab.

Throughout the lab you will find **callouts**, highlighting items that require your attention, providing tips or congratulating you for a job well done. Here are a few examples:

## Git

Stoplight Studio is a powerful `git` client that allows users to leverage version control to power their API designs. This approach provides greater collaboration, a familiar review process and gives your team full ownership over the source of truth for your design documents. 

As a result there are a few key features that you should be aware of:

### Branches

Studio can checkout existing git branches and create new branches as you are working with your API designs and documentation.

> ### Hint...
>
>*If you get distracted or make a mistake you can always checkout the appropriate branch for each section to catch up (or fast forward).*

### Push

Studio can push your changes to new or existing branches on your source control. You can also compare changes and add commit messages when you push a change.

### Pull

To get the latest update from your repository, click on the button called '*Pull latest from git repo*'.

## Tabs

Studio will also organize your repository into functional tabs to make your work easier. 

### APIs
If you are focused on API design, the 'APIs' tab will only display OpenAPI and model files.

### Docs
If you are writing behavioral documentation, the 'Docs' tab will display markdown files and other assets such as images.

### Files
The 'Files' tab will display all files and directories located in your repository in case you need them.

## Views

Studio provides two different methods for writing OpenAPI files and models: a `form` editor and a `code` editor. Use whichever method you prefer, however people who are new to OpenAPI and those with more experience both agree that the `form` editor makes them write OpenAPI faster, with less mistakes and with much less of a cognitive load.

The `preview` will give you feedback and display what your files will look like in the form of documentation. Use this view to gauge the results of the content you are writing in Studio.

You can have either the `form` or `code` view side-by-side with the `preview` to get immediate feedback.
