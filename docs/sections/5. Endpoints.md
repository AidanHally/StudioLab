# Endpoints

The next step is to add `endpoints` to your API. To do so, click on the blue 'plus' icon (`+`) on the top left of the UI and select '**Endpoint**'.

You will then be presented with this window to add a `path` and `endpoints` to your API:

![add endpoints](../../assets/images/addEndpoints.png)

Select the '**Devices API**' and add the following path: `/api/devices`.

Next add a `GET` and a `POST` methods, naming them accordingly. Finish by clicking on '**Create**'.

## Describe your Endpoints

The `endpoints` need descriptions, parameters, request and response bodies in order to be useful. Let's start with the `GET` method.

### Path Parameters

Add a `path parameter` called '**accountid**' with a simple description and an sample value. This parameter is being written inline for the entire path and will be shared with the `POST` method.

The parameter should look like this:

### Header and Query Parameters

Next you will add `Header` and `Query` parameters as well as an API token to secure your endpoint. This time we will use references (`$ref`) like you did with models. This way you reuse components rather than define everytime you need them.

Click on '**+ Security**' to add the API key defined in the API overview. Likewise click on '**+ Header**' to add a `header` parameter called '**deviceid**'. You will notice that you can reference components using paths such as this:

`#/components/parameters/deviceid`

This indicates that you are reusing a parameter from the components section you had copy/pasted earlier. The following image shows what this looks like and the green arrow indicates the button that allows users to use a reference.

Click on '**+ Query Param**' to add the query parameters '**sort**', '**limit**' and '**spaceid**'.

This example demonstrates how to accomplish this step:

### Response Body

Now add a `response body`. Click on '**+ Response**' and then '**+ Add Body**'. Change the schema's default field to a reference (`$ref`) and use the model we created earlier `devices.v1.json`.

### More Responses

To add more responses such as errors click again on '**+ Response**' and use the response code dropdown to select `500 Internal Server Error`. As you did with the `200 OK`, replace the default object field in the schema with a reference to the `error.v1.yaml` model.

### POST

As you just did with the `GET` method, proceed to describe and secure the remaining `POST` method.

This time you will just need the '**deviceName**' `header` parameter and '**spaceid**' `query` parameter.

![post parameters](../../assets/images/postparams.png)

### Request Body

For a `POST` method we are going to need a `request body`. Click on '**+ Body**' and change the default object field of the schema to a reference to the `devices.v1.json` model.

![request body](../../assets/images/requestBody.png)

### 201 Created

To finish this section add a `201 Created` response to the `POST` method. Click on '**+ Response**', select the response code `201 Created` from the dropdown and set the reference to the `responseCode.v1.yaml` model.
