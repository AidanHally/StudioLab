# Endpoints

The next step is to add `endpoints` to your API. To do so, click on the blue 'plus' icon (`+`) on the top left of the UI and select '**Endpoint**'.

You will then be presented with this window to add a `path` and `endpoints` to your API:

![add endpoints](../../assets/images/addEndpoints.png)

Select the '**Devices API**' and add the following path: `/api/devices`.

Next add a `GET` and a `POST` operation, naming them accordingly. Finish by clicking on '**Create**'.

## Describe your Endpoints

The `endpoints` need descriptions, parameters, request and response bodies in order to be useful. Let's start with the `GET` operation.

### Path Parameters

Add a `path parameter` called '**accountid**' with a simple description and an sample value. This parameter is being written inline for the entire path and will be shared with the `POST` operation.

The parameter should look like this:
