# Endpoints

The next step is to add `endpoints` to your API. To do so, click on the blue 'plus' icon (`+`) on the top left of the UI and select 'Endpoint'.

You will then be presented with this window to add a `path` and `endpoints` to your API:

![add endpoints](../../assets/images/addEndpoints.png)

Select the 'Devices API' and add the following path: `/api/devices`.

Next add a `GET` and a `POST` operation, naming them accordingly.
