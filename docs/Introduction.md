# Welcome to the Studio Lab!

![logo](../assets/images/logo.png)

This workshop provides a hands-on learning experience on the usage of **Stoplight Studio** to write `OpenAPI` files, models (schemas) and markdown articles. The lab will also cover working with **styleguides** (`Spectral`) and **configuration files** for advanced users to provide a full understanding of **Studio**'s functionality.

The **Studio** lab provides a `starter` branch which you will use to complete the exercises. It also contains a `final` branch that serves as a reference for the end result. As you progress through each section you can compare your work with branches named after each step - *much like a cooking show!*

To learn more about how branches work, checkout the next section called '**Training Environment**'.
